## Future Improvements

Here are some of the improvements that I hope to implement in the future:

- **Auth and ranking system.** I plan to add an authentication system that allows users to create accounts and track their progress over time. I also plan to add a ranking system so that users can compete with each other.
- **Different game modes.** I plan to add different game modes that offer different challenges and help users practice different aspects of typing.
- **More settings.** I plan to add more settings that allow users to customize the app to their liking.
- **Theming.** I plan to add theming options that allow users to change the look and feel of the app.
